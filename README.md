## Overview

### The project

This project was designed as part of [**The Complete JavaScript Course 2023**](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/). I learned the concept of JavaScript, CSS, and HTML from the tutorial and I built this project along with the tutorial.
It is responsive on big screen devices.
